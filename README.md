# Supervised Machine Learning
## Objective
The goal of this repository is to build and evaluate several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from LendingClub; a peer-to-peer lending services company.
* Implement machine learning models.
* Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
* Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
